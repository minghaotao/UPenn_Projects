🛠️ Penn Engineering Online: Project Collection
This repository contains a collection of automation and reporting scripts developed for various operational tasks at Penn Engineering Online. These tools support program-wide analysis and streamline routine processes across multiple courses.

📊 Ed Discussion Analytics
We pull data from Ed Discussion across all courses in the program. Each week, a script calculates the following:

Response rate

Number of unresolved posts

Number of resolved posts

Posts not answered within 24 hours

A weekly report is then automatically posted to the team Slack channel, enabling us to easily monitor TA responsiveness across courses.

📝 Entering Zeros for Missing Assignments
To ensure advisors have accurate, up-to-date information from the Canvas Gradebook, it's important to enter zeros for students who missed assignments.

Many courses use third-party tools like Gradescope and Codio. This script identifies cases where:

The due date has passed by more than 9 days

Some grades have been entered for the assignment

Some students still have no grades

Once these criteria are met, the script enters zeros for students without grades.

📂 Extension File Tracker
Each semester, we receive over 2,000 extension requests. This script tracks and summarizes the weekly number of:

Approved extensions

Denied extensions

The resulting report gives instructors a weekly overview of extension trends across courses.

⏱️ Gradescope Late Submissions Sync
Some courses apply daily late penalties for late submissions. Managing this manually is time-consuming.

This script automates the process by:

Accessing Gradescope Gradebook

Capturing the late submission status and timestamps

Uploading this data to the corresponding Canvas assignments

As a result, Canvas can automatically apply the late penalty policy.

🤖 Slack Bot Integration
We use a custom Slack Bot to distribute reports generated by various scripts. The bot uses the Slack API to send:

Text reports

Images and data visualizations

It supports seamless, automated communication within our internal workflows.

📅 WaitWhile (TA Office Hours Platform)
We use WaitWhile to manage and track TA office hours. This script aggregates weekly data from all courses, showing:

How many office hours were offered

Which courses are offering the most or least OHs

This gives us a high-level overview of TA support across the program.
